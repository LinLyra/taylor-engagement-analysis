Think of all the people who save and scrimp all the globe to buy tickets and merchandise at Taylor's over-rated concerts.  Think. About. That.  She's greedy and a marketing machine that thrives on adolescents and their parents.  All right before her new album which will contain immature lyrics hits the streams and store shelves.

u_bwk8xMOeI,top,@TM2005-q3m,"I do believe these two are dating and that Taylor is a heterosexual woman who has never had a fake relationship. That being said, I don't believe these two will last. Any marriage Taylor has will lead to a divorce (and successful album) even if the marriage miraculously manages to last 5-10 years. She has no ""end game"". I imagine she'll have two or three failed marriages in her life.

Obviously, I don't personally know Taylor. I have never met her, but if she saw a mental health professional and was diagnosed with a personality disorder, it wouldn't shock me.

The world won't gaslight me into thinking it's normal to have 10 relationships as an adult that lasted 6 months on average and that each relationship ended dramatically and not a single fault belongs to Taylor. She could easily make a social media post asking her fans to not harass her exes and their families, but she doesn't. She continues to make this type of music despite knowing how Swifties behave. She didn't care about Joe Alwyn's depression; let's be glad that he survived online bullying, because sometimes people who suffer from depression meet with tragic ends when they're constantly harassed. And how was his depression a crime against Taylor? ""I was in a prison. I was going down with the ship"". Taylor has more money, fame, and power than all her exes combined, she was not married to Joe and had no kids with him, nothing tied them together, so why instead of leaving in 2021/2022 like a normal person would did she wait to monkey branch to Matty Healy? Then there was her weird need to take shots at Joe during her Times Person of the Year interview, which when you compare what she says to how Joe talked about their break up, shows her immaturity. And what's with her doing a pap walk when Matty announced his engagement? I thought she was happy with Travis? I don't like Matty, but mocking his drug addiction was psychopathic, almost as heartless as how she handled Ana's death.

There's the cheeky Anti-Hero, the most narcissistic pop song I've had the displeasure of hearing since Me!, where she claps back at detractors for pointing out she's the common denominator in all her failed relationships and all of her exes have had many long, healthy relationships. I'm sure there's a reason all of her exes, except for clout chasing Lautner, cringe when her name is brought up. I'm sure there's a reason 90% of her friendships fail, and I doubt it's jealousy. She can be ironic about it, but Taylor is in fact the problem. If one bothers to do a little research they'll see she's often the one who starts feuds. Taylor was not using the dancers who willingly left her tour for Katy Perry's tour, and Taylor signed the contract and entered into a legal business deal her father made $15 million on concerning the whole Scooter Braun thing.

There was nothing normal about 23 year old Taylor checking her boyfriend Conor Kennedy out of High School, or buying a mansion by his house after 5 weeks of dating. It's not normal to meet the parents of multiple boyfriends within the first week of dating. It's not normal that Taylor said she was happier than she's ever been and that she loved Matty Healy (during the height of his controversies) after dating him for 3 days. Maybe it's normal for a 20 year old, but not a 33 year old. If you're trying to ""fix the bad boy"" at 33 please seek therapy. It's not normal that she mentioned Travis in her Person of the Year interview, the most important interview in her career, after 3 months of dating. The fact she's used multiple muses to sing about ""forever"" and ""the one"" tells me she's in love with being in love and not the actual muses. The fact she seems to fall in love with every guy she meets, from Adam Young to Travis Kelce, tells me she probably confuses infatuation with love.

What really bothers me is the public's need to convince us that Taylor is a role model. I want my nieces to look up to a badass like P!nk or someone who actually cares about issues like Olivia Rodrigo, not someone whose personality depends on her bf; not someone who cozies up to Jackson Mahomes, Dave Portnoy, Taylor Lewan (look up what he said about Alanna Berger), hangs out in Jason Aldean's bar, shouts out Brad Pitt on a podcast, among other things.

And why is it ""eat the rich"" and ""f**k Billionaires"" and ""f**k Capitalism"" but it's okay for Taylor because Taylor is a ""comfort billionaire"", ""Capitalistic Barbie"", etc. Why is it when I point out she was the worst polluter of 2022 and in 2023 she unleashed 138 tons of CO2, the usual response is ""yeah but so-and-so is worse"". I get that so-and-so is worse, but what does that have to do with Taylor and how does that excuse her?

All these Travis narratives are ridiculous. Since when did he become ""America's sweetheart""? Did everyone forget his fatphobic tweets? Did no one see his interview with Andy Cohen where he said it's a deal breaker if he doesn't get bl*wjobs? Did everyone forget him blowing up on the field and nearly knocking over Coach Reid at the Super Bowl? Did no one see his interview on the Pivot podcast where he said ""I prefer the dark meat, but you know me, I don't discriminate on the chicken baby"" (this was January 2023) in his gross blaccent. Did no one hear him tell his mother ""I need a breeder"" on New Heights in February 2023?

This ""me dumb, you smart"" thing Tayvis does isn't endearing. Stupidity isn't something to strive for and I can't believe people say they want this kind of relationship when the dynamic seems so unequal. Maybe it's cute in sitcoms, but it's weird to see in real life. I don't want young men to think they should be uneducated. Give me a relationship like Tim McGraw/Faith Hill or Courtney Vance/Angela Bassett. I don't want an idiot, and I don't want a narcissist hell bent on convincing the world she has a 140 IQ by reciting a dictionary in a controlled environment (rewatch New Heights and you'll see she was reading triskaidekaphobia off of a screen to make sure she was pronouncing it correctly) when this is her unfiltered and unprepared

As you can tell, I am tired of hearing about Taylor and Travis. I'm tired of hearing about how they're not problematic. I'm tired of hearing about how they're a perfect couple because he's a golden retriever/himbo and she's ""a genius"" and they both ""mind their own business"", as if Taylor won't do a pap walk the day Matty gets married or Joe is seen in public with a new gf.",0,2025-08-27T05:26:04Z,0

Seeing Kelse's non-football side and he's a good dude and can be really funny. Just see him in Happy Gilmore 2, where supposedly he was given freedom in takes to do/say whatever he wanted and those are the scenes that were used in movie. 
Is Josh Allen and Haliee Steinfeld engaged as well?  I hope now their less public relationship will be what happens with soon to be Mr. & Ms. Kelse! Or Swift-Kelse. whatever she chooses to do?

While a precise number is difficult to state as it can be subjective to interpret themes, it is estimated that a significant portion of Taylor Swift's discography, around 30% to 38%, deals with breakups and unsuccessful romances. Some analyses indicate this could be as many as 39 songs out of her first 140. 
""All Taylor Swift Does Is Write Breakup Songs"" --A Study:
A Reddit thread noted that 39 out of 140 songs (around 28%) were about breakups, according to their 2020 analysis. 
High Percentage in Early Albums:
In her early albums, including Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now, and Red, a high percentage of songs focused on relationships and breaking up, with one source citing that 38% of songs from those albums were about breakups. 
Ongoing Theme:
Breakup themes continue to be a prominent part of her songwriting, even in more recent albums like Folklore, which features several songs dealing with the topic. 
The ""Breakup Album"" Reputation:
The strong association with breakup songs is often debated, but the data suggests a large number of her songs do explore this theme, whether it be heartbreak, jealousy, or the desire for closure.",0,2025-08-27T02:30:15Z,0

u_bwk8xMOeI,top,@borrowedtruths6955,"Second Class Citizens


“Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: (1st Peter 3:6a)

 Judah took a wife, and unless she had died, apparently it did not bother him too much to buy a hooker, or if it offends you, a lady of the evening, which turned out to be his daughter-in-law. Isaac loved Rebekah, but the first thing we are told is that he was consoled over the death of his mother, so did he really desire a wife, or a replacement?
 
How many wives and bound concubines, another polite word, did David have? Or Solomon? We know that at least Peter was married, and as far as we are told, “Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?” (Matt. 19:27) 

Second class citizens, nice to have around when we need something, and please, do not attempt to say, “That was the culture then,” or “It was beyond honorable for a man to leave his wife to follow Christ.” 

“A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;” (1st Tim. 3:2) 

Why? Why change that all of a sudden. And then there is this.
 
“Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;” (Eph. 5:25) 

Christ is portrayed as a husband to the church, the body of believers, unmitigated love, enduring, without end. Any God-fearing woman will tell you it is a blessing and an honorable place to be second in the life of a husband who serves the Lord Jesus Christ, but if that man ever causes her to feel as if she is second place, you can forget about a happy, loving marriage. 

You can say that women had very few rights in the days of the Old Testament, that it was kindness that caused a man to marry many women, that they were not allowed certain privileges that men had.
 
Whose fault was that God’s or man’s? 

“I am not as good as you are, so I will call you Lord.” 

“What difference does it make how many wives I have, each are loved for themselves, for who they are.” 

“I am doing her a favor, for women do not have the same rights as men.”
 
Sure, that works, do not concern yourself with her emotions, her feelings, if it was not for you marrying her, she would be destitute, and if I choose to marry another as well, or fulfill the lust of my flesh occasionally, I have the right to do so, because I am the man of the house. 

“And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.” (Mark 10:8) 

In many religious organizations, women are still treated as less than men, and worse, and in some nations that is seen as detestable. Why? Wasn’t it always like that, did not much of what was just written here prove that fact? 

Try telling anyone that you as a man of God serve the Lord Jesus Christ and then see what they say when they discover that you treat your wife as a second-class citizen, that much of your time is spent serving the Living God, and when you need her for something, she says, “Yes, Lord.” 

Every time my lovely wife and I go somewhere, we hold each other’s hand, even when we are upset with each other. She will never come before Christ in my life, but she will always come before you, before everyone and everything else in my life. She is second only to One.
 
Don’t tell me about past cultures, they were wrong, completely out of the will of the Almighty. 

If you are a married man of God, and you are not willing to die in every area of your life for your wife, then you are not prepared to die for Christ in any part of your life.

u_bwk8xMOeI,top,@ImACarbonCopy,"he will regret his decision..but I hope it works out for them...Based on wealth alone, a marriage between a millionaire man and a billionaire woman has a high risk of ending in divorce. While couples with moderate wealth tend to have lower divorce rates than those with less income, this trend reverses at the highest levels of wealth, where divorce rates are similar to or higher than the general population. women are hypergamous in nature...Destabilizing factors
Skewed power dynamics: A significant wealth disparity, particularly when the woman is the primary earner, can challenge traditional gender roles and create power imbalances.
One study showed that women who are primary earners in a relationship are more likely to keep their finances separate from their partner.
The higher-earning woman may resent that her partner can't match her financial contributions, while the man might feel inadequate or that his motivations are questioned...Ego and narcissism: The drive and personality traits that lead to immense success can sometimes include high levels of ego, inflexibility, and narcissism, which can be detrimental to a healthy relationship.

Wow, you Republicans really know how to diminish a woman's life right away. You want to downgrade them, get him out of the place. What's wrong, Scott? You want Taylor Smith to lose her figure? So you can't look at it. No more well, what is it? Why do you want her to have so many babies? Scott, your wife can't give you any yo aint that sad, but I think you Republicans should just stay out of people's lives and let them run their own lives the way they s***, the way they feel happy. It doesn't matter if they have one kid or not. 20 kids don't matter, you don't tell nobody to go. And have a whole bunch of kids. Why don't you and your wife doing? You're so worried about kids, or is it too scared that your party doesn't care about kids? The way these billionaires are abusing and molesting them Is that what you'd like to hear? Because billionaires don't give a s*** who they rape, who they kill. They don't care. That's the way they are getting away with everything. Look at your favorite President, Scott. He's getting away with 30 for felonies. I guarantee you if it was you in his place. You wouldn't even survive the first felony. What the hell are you talking about? You like a dictator a person that might be involved in molesting kids. A President that raped women zette, the kind of power you Republicans, want do what you want with people? Well, those king days are over. They're done and overburied. If I were you Scott, why don't you just stay out of people's lives? And let them choose their own way of life. Don't tell nobody to go and have a whole bunch of kids. You freaking idiot? And that's my opinion, Scott. Oh sorry, Scott, that might have hurt your feelings about your Republicans.

Why It Was So… Ridiculous

Wedding televised like a cooking demo: A deeply personal moment turned into a morning show feature felt staged and trivialized.

And He is coming for His children SOON, to take us home with Him.  Jesus was crucified, died for our sins and was resurrected by God the Father three days later.  He now sits at the right hand of Power!

Jesus wants us to be with Him in heaven.  And He is the only way.  If you don't know Jesus, please pray this prayer: ""God Almighty, I'm a sinner.  I turn from my sins now and follow you, Jesus Christ, and ask for your forgiveness.  I believe You are the Son of God, who died on the cross and were resurrected on the third day by God the Father.  Thank you for dying for my sins, Jesus and cleansing me with your precious blood.  In Jesus' name, Amen.""  

Read the book of John and ask Jesus to reveal Himself to you.  Believe in who Jesus is and what He has done. You have nothing to lose and eternal life to gain. Be saved from an eternity without His love!

It's not like back in the day when couples stuck it out through thick & thin. In todays society, the least little thing happens, couples are ready to throw in the towel. America has the highest divorce rate of any industrialized country in the world. My parents were married for 45 years before my mother passed, and then my father a couple years later.

Some of you are blowing up because you’re under the false assumption that Fox News is an actual news outlet. The president of Fox clearly stated that “Fox News is not a news outlet, it’s an entertainment outlet” So if the network use to be Cable News, the president stated it is not. So yeah, who cares with any of these celebrities,  BUT being upset because you think it’s a “news” network is wrong for two reasons. 1. It’s not a news network. 2. Even if it wasn’t an entertainment network and was a real news network, their engagement would make it on FOX anyway, because of their fame and popularity. Before someone say, “fake liberal statement” it actually is not since the president of the network stated it himself, and if he lied to avoid a lawsuit, that’s worse because he’s not standing behind the content being shown and by claiming it’s entertainment, make the content nothing more than a play at ratings, sort of like the “Real Housewives” and the table flip. Bottom line, their engagement is big news for fans and yes some of their fans watch Fox “News”. Me, don’t care.
