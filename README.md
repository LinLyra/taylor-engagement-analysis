# Taylor Swift Engagement Analysis

This notebook analyzes YouTube comments related to Taylor Swiftâ€™s engagement news.  
We apply the **Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM)** and **sentiment analysis** to study persuasion, attention dynamics, and economic-like behavior online.

## Features
- Data collection via YouTube API
- Classification into central vs peripheral routes
- Sentiment analysis (positive / neutral / negative)
- Bayesian updating, herding, polarization
- Human validation of AI classification

## Results
- Peripheral route (~80%) dominates
- Negativity outweighed positivity
- Herding and polarization dynamics similar to financial markets
- Attention spikes then decays
- Positive/central comments attract more likes despite being fewer
